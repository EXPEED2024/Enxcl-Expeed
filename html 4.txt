           <b> enxcl’s deep understanding of the industry enables us to impart innovative, insightful, and industry-relevant training programs to corporates, professionals, and IT career aspirants. For corporates, we provide customized leadership and management trainings as per the vision of the client organization. We start with assessing the current state and with clarity of the future state as per the roles held. Whether the roles handled may be in delivery leadership, customer handling, risk management, product management, service management, or implementation management, we are equipped to assess them and identify the gaps. Further, we deliver customized and tailored skill enhancement programs. Being one of the Premier Authorized Training Partners of Project Management Institute (PMI) globally, we deliver Project Management and Agile trainings through sought-after industry experts having many decades of experience.

            enxcl is also closely connected with academia and leverages our connection with the industry to understand and bridge the gap between academia and industry. We have designed training programs that address this very issue. We offer fresh graduates job-oriented comprehensive courses with live projects and placement support and prepare them for global certifications. We also collaborate with leading colleges across the state in delivering customized skill enhancement programs that are again industry specific.
            
            Our connection with both industry and the colleges enables us to work with both in offering multiple models for delivering the right resource with the right skill for the right job. Under the Train-To-Hire Model, we understand our partner companies’ technical requirements and select the right candidates who are then trained on them. The company can later assess these candidates and hire them for their needs. Under the Train-Hire-Deploy program, companies select suitable candidates and partner with us to deliver customized training programs.
